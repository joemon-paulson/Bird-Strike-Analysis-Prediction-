# Bird-Strike-Analysis-Prediction-
we have taken the data set from the Federal Aviation Administration website. That data set is targeting the bird strike occurrences and the repercussions faced by the airport authority or the pilot flying the aircraft. Here, we will be predicting the prevention of damages due to bird strike, as well as, creating a warning signal that will help pilots and the authority to avoid this damage. The data set is the most recent (Jan 01-2020 to Jun 01-2023) and is obtained from the FAA Website

Within these 3 years (Jan 01-2020 to Jun 01-2023), we will have to articulate a model that defines the highest accuracy of a model to predict damages due to bird strike. Some of the attributes in the tables contains the damages caused to which parts of the aircraft? how much did the damage cost? where did the strike occurred? which part of the country, the aircraft was flying to? did the damage occur, what kind of bird species was it? what was its size? how far was the aircraft from the airport? what was its speed? what was the altitude?
